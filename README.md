*Kodiak*, a C++ Library for Rigorous Branch and Bound Computation
=================================================================

*Kodiak* is a C++ library that implements a generic branch and bound
algorithm for rigorous numerical approximations. Particular instances
of the branch and bound algorithm allow the user to refine and
isolate solutions to systems of nonlinear equations and inequalities,
global optimization problems, and bifurcation sets for systems of
ODEs. Kodiak utilizes interval arithmetic (via the [filib++](www2.math.uni-wuppertal.de/wrswt/software/filib.html) library)
and Bernstein enclosure (for polynomials and rational functions) as
self-validating enclosure methods. Symbolic operations support
procedures such as automatic partial differentiation.

### Documentation

Currently, the main documentation is contained in this file.
Publications concerning the library and associated algorithms are in
preparation. There are also numerous comments in the source code.

### Support and Contribution

See the instructions in this file and the linked resources.
For further assistance, or to report problems and bugs, please
contact the authors. Contributions to the library are welcomed.

Obtaining *Kodiak*
------------------

The repository is located at:
[https://github.com/nasa/Kodiak/](https://github.com/nasa/Kodiak/)

License
-------

The Kodiak C++ Library is released under NASA's Open Source Agreement.
See the files `LICENSES/Kodiak-NOSA.pdf` and `LICENSES/Kodiak-BooleanChecker-NOSA.pdf`;
see also the copyright notice at the end of this file.

Installation and Usage Options
------------------------------

*Kodiak* is installed from source code.
*Kodiak* is run by encoding a problem in a C++ program file, then compiling and running it.

### 2. Prerequisites

It is recommended to run *Kodiak* on a Linux or Mac computer with the
GNU C++ compiler; so far it has been successfully tested on Ubuntu Linux
and Mac OS X. Use of Windows is not supported, although it ought to be
feasible, and the authors would welcome any report of successfully
running the software on Windows or any other system.

The following software should firstly be installed, if not already
present (please follow the links for instructions and support):

* **C++** compiler (standard `>=C++14` required)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org) build tool (version `>=3.12` required)
* [filib++](http://www2.math.uni-wuppertal.de/wrswt/software/filib.html) interval library (version `3.0.2` required) configured with the following options:
  ```
  $ ./configure CFLAGS=-fPIC CPPFLAGS=-fPIC CXXFLAGS=-fPIC
  ```
  before invoking the `make` commands:
  ```
  $ make
  $ make install
  ```

* *Boost* libraries (only for debugging):
  [http://www.boost.org/users/download/](http://www.boost.org/users/download/)
  In addition to the headers, you need at least the library
  `serialization`.


### 2. Build Library and Examples

If necessary, unzip the zip file in order to extract the files.
The following files and directories should be present:

* In the working directory: this `README.md` file and a `CMakeListst.txt` file
* `LICENSES`: licenses and copyrights for *Kodiak*
* `logo`: *Kodiak*'s logo and credits
* `src`: source code for the library
* `examples`: example C++ files  (`.cpp`) containing several problems

If any of the prerequisite libraries were installed in non-standard
directories, then the file `CMakeLists.txt` should be modified accordingly.

Create a `build` directory to keep the compiled libraries and make it
the current working directory:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```

Now, run *CMake* for creating the build scripts:
```
$ cmake ..
```
If this command fails because *CMake* cannot find *FILIB*, add the `FILIB_ROOT` environment variable with the path to the *FILIB* source code directory used during the installation.
```
$ FILIB_ROOT=<FILIB-directory> cmake ..
```

Finally, build all targets by invoking the *CMake* build command:
```
$ cmake --build .
```

Using the Library
-----------------

The *Kodiak* library is used in your own C/C++ programs.
A good way to start is to take one of the existing `.cpp`
files in the `examples` directory and adapt it to your purposes.
You can either invoke the compiler directly with a link to the
*filib++* and *Kodiak* libraries, or else add a new entry to
the `examples/CMakeLists.txt` file.
For C programs, please use the `src/Adapters/Codiak.h` header file to invoke *Kodiak*'s routines.

Be aware that care must be taken with the order in which commands
are invoked. All variables should be declared before any variable
resolutions are set.
